# Convert Orchard CMS messages to toastr notifications with JavaScript

Orchard messages appear as text messages in the Messages Zone. But sometimes we need something fancier than a simple text.

## Installation
 + Install to your Orchard Site the [Toastr](https://github.com/CodeSeven/toastr) library.
 + Call the `messages.js` from the `Layout.cshtml` file in your active theme.
 + Hide the messages with CSS, with this: `.zone-messages .message { display: none; }`
